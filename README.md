## Compilation Instructions
How do we compile your program?
* At the top of Visual Studio, click the start button and it will run the program after a moment of compilation.

## Program Usage
How do we run your program? Does it expect any Inputs?
* The program will give you prompts to solve the guessing game. It generally expects numerical inputs.

## Notes
Any extra notes, such as:
* What is working?
      * Using whole number integers for your answers works.
* What are the limitations of your program?
  * I thought I fixed it, however, I did not as of now. Please don't try to input words, as it will try to change your string into a 32-bit int and it will crash.
* What design decisoins did you make?
  * I tried to make the prompts more accurate explanation wise, witout making it too wordy.
* Is there anything you wish to draw our attention to? (cool trick, extra credit, strange logic, problem area, etc)
  * Not really, as I am lucky I got this to work to begin with. I hope to do better stuff as I get used to C# and Visual Studio.
